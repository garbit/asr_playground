I do hear this whole undercurrent about Joe Biden is gonna be the only one who could beat Trump and all of this stuff. I think Democrats are gonna have to get over their issues and their egos, and they're gonna have to work together. And I think it involves having like transgenerational and different genders and having other different races, other people like that in a ticket. Instead of everyone trying to be the head honcho, like realize that probably two of y'all would be better. So I could see a combination of Elizabeth Warren and someone else, or Joe Biden and someone. Thanks, the A-Brown. And Stacy A. Or someone just younger. Someone just younger. It's exhausting. Like Barack Obama was 47 when he was voted into office. Like all these, and this is no, I'm not trying to be ages or anything, but like when all the candidates are like in their 70s, I'm kinda like, how long are you gonna be around? What's gonna happen?

    "text": " I'm still very hopeful that we get a third party option. I think Justin Amash is thinking about potentially getting in, and there still may be another Republican primary challenger. I think before the end of the summer, we'll know whether or not somebody else is going to get in. I think somebody else should get in. I think someone should make a pitch for a 21st century Republican party that isn't built around a cult of personality around Donald Trump. There's a lot of people who could do that, young Republican congressmen or other folks. If we don't get that, and I'm forced into a binary choice between Trump and a Democrat, it's going to really depend on the Democrat. I'm never going to vote for Bernie Sanders. There's just no way. And I would probably vote for my mom. Yeah, that's right, right, right, right. But here's the thing. Look, if it's somebody like Joe Biden, look, do I agree with Joe Biden on most issues? I do not. But I don't think that the world is going to be plunged into a socialist hellscape because of four years of Joe Biden. I think you can go back and beat him later with a future leader of the Republican Party who will make a lot more sense to me than Donald Trump.",
